    <p id= intro-action>Climate change is an ever-growing issue that affects all of us. Scientists estimate that we have but a decade to prevent irreparable damage to our planet. Individuals can take action to slow the damage by implementing small changes in their lifestyles. There are an abundance of steps that everyone can take to lessen their carbon footprint. </p>

    <h4>1. try alternate forms of transportation
</h4>
    <p class= "action-text">An average personal vehicle emits close to 5 metric tons of carbon per year, according to the EPA. Reduce your carbon footprint by refraining from taking unnecessary car trips. Save yourself the gas money and try walking, biking, or taking public transportation. </p>

    <br>
    <h4>2. eat plant-based</h4>
    <p class= "action-text">A sustainable, healthy diet, according to the 2022 IPCC (intergovernmental panel on climate change) report, promotes health and has a low environmental impact. A key part of that, according to their report is plant - based diets, based on legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Meat production is a definite contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, both in the transportation and raising of livestock. A 2013 UN report estimated that the livestock sector, globally, produced 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, comparable to the emissions from all other transport, combined. There is evidence that a plant - based diet is best for personal health. A reduction in meat consumption overall will help both individuals and the planet as a whole.

    <h4>3. buy long-lasting, quality clothing</h4>
    <p class= "action-text">We know it can be tempting to buy the cheapest, trendiest clothing at the time. However, these clothes go in and out of style rapidly. Did you know that the average American throws away an estimated 37kg/81lbs of clothing per year? Instead of buying pieces that will be out of style by next month, invest in some high quality clothing that will last you a lifetime.

    <br>
    <h4>4. save energy at home</h4>
    <p class= "action-text">Switch your home to rely on renewable energy sources like wind or solar energy by talking to your utility company and figuring out how they generate their power. But if this isn’t possible, invest in energy - efficient appliances. Look for the Energy Star label to tell you which are most efficient. According to the NRDC, efficiency standards for appliances and products have kept 2.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the air since they were first implemented in 1987. That is the same amount as the annual carbon pollution from 440 million cars, which is 37% more than the number of registered vehicles in the US as of 2019. Also, try to lower your heat and cooling systems, wash your laundry with cold water, and hang things to dry instead of using a dryer when possible.</p>

    <img src="assets/action, recycle.jpg" class="action" alt="a close up photograph of a blue recycling bin"align=left>
    <br>
    <h4>5. recycle and compost </h4>
    <p class= "action-text">10%  of US energy goes into the process of growing, packaging and shipping food, despite the fact that 40% of food ends up in landfills. Food waste is a major contributor to climate change as a result of the energy consumption necessary to produce this food and the methane released when it sits in landfills. Try to actually eat all the food you buy, and when that isn’t possible, compost. Composting also improves soil health and recycles nutrients. Individuals in the US recycle/ compost approximately ⅓ of all total trash, but more can be done. It should be a priority to reduce the amount of plastic we buy, but also recycle according to the rules in your location. </p>

    <br>
    <h4>6. become politically involved</h4>
    <p class= "action-text">Possibly the most crucial one, vote for politicians that will take action to protect the environment! A 2017 study reveals that a mere 100 corporations are responsible for over 70% of all greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 (cdp.net). This can be reduced through new laws and regulations targeting said corporations. Exercise your right to vote and elect politicians that will take the initiative and enact such laws!</p>
