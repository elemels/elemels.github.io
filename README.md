This website was created in 2022 as an activist project for a Girls Who Code summer program. While it aimed to help us practice and learn to code, both of the programmers, Ellie and Elizabeth, are passionate about the Earth and preserving its beauty and resources. Our mission is to spread awareness about ways that the average person can fight climate change by changing our lifestyles and electing people who will further environmental causes at the governmental level.
